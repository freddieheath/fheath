        <p>
          I started developing in my first year of university after doing a web
          dev module and I have done it as a hobby ever since. I graduated a
          Media Communications degree from UAL: London College of Communication
          in 2024 and Iâ€™m currently looking for entry level roles in advertising
          and marketing.
